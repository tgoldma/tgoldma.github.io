      <p>I am very excited about starting and learning in this class. I always enjoy learning new things especially when the subject matter is challenging. My goal is to be a master at coding. I would like my skills to be good enough where it becomes second nature. Since coding and anaylitics is very new to me I donâ€™t have a particular favorite subject matter yet, however I am excited to learn all subject topics equally. My goal is to take advantage of all resources inside and outside of class to ensure my success. The group work also seems like something that I will excel in and benefit from. </p>
      <p>The skills that I will learn in this class will enable me to become more marketable and open more career options for me. Mastering the skills that I learn in this class are not skills that everyone has in the workforce. I will be seen as a skilled employable prospect. I hope to obtain a position as an analyst that will give me room to grow as an expert. I hope to be good enough and such an expert that I will become an indispensable and transcendent employee. I am very excited to start on this journey. <p>
